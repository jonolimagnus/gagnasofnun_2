	2:
    Insert student data along with their registration.
    First check that the table and column names in the script are the same as in the new tables.  If not change either on so that the insert works.
    
    Possibly try out the new data by issuing a select query on the new tables.
    
    
    
    3:
    The assignment contains two files. One is a script for a Firm database and the other is an ERD of the same.
    Please do the following:
    
		3a:
        Check if the tables are in 3NF and if not put them in that form according to normalization rules.
        
        3b:
        Create consistance in column names throught the database and use either camelCase, PascalCase or
        snake_case.
        Try to recieve an overall consistance.
        
        3c:
        Put  proper relations between the tables in the database.  NOTE: 
        When you normalize the database it will yield more tables that you 
        will of course contain in this process.
        
        3d:
        Insert some test data into the "updated" database. 
        For example one firm with two divisions and five members of staff that produces three products.
